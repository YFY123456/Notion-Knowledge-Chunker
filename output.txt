Chunk 1:

1. Getting started
Welcome to the connected workspace where better, faster work happens. Let’s cover all the things you need to know to begin exploring Notion.


Start here
Curious about what Notion is? We'll show you right here, and in the articles to come. Let's go! 📍


What is a block?
Think of Notion as a bottomless bin of building blocks. Build whatever you want, however you want! Every page you create in Notion will be composed of many "blocks," in the same way a LEGO castle is composed of many LEGO bricks 🧱




Everything in Notion is a "block"
When you create your first page in Notion and begin typing, you've started with a text block. But Notion pages can contain a lot more than plain text!
Imagine every piece of content you add to a page — whether it's text, an image, or a table — as a single building block. Every page is a stack of blocks combined however you want.
Here's just one example page with different block types pointed out:

Tip: Hit the / key on your keyboard (or tap the + button above your keyboard if you're on mobile) to see all the different types of content you can add.



Blocks can transform
Any block in Notion can be turned into any other type of block in order to use, view, or deepen that information in a new way.
Try this out by clicking the ⋮⋮ symbol and choosing Turn into to convert your block to something else!


Create a page
Every page you create in Notion is a fresh canvas where you can add whatever content you want. Follow these steps to create your first one 📄




Create a page
There are a few ways to add a new page in Notion. 
Click 📝 at the top of your left sidebar.
If you’re on the desktop app, use the shortcut cmd/ctrl + N.
If you’re on mobile, tap 📝 at the bottom of your screen.


Start writing
Once your new page opens, you can give your page a title and start jotting down your thoughts.
Need some inspiration or structure? On desktop or web, select any of the options at the bottom of the page to get started. You can import from an app or file, use a template, create a table, and more — select an option you like, and your page will be formatted accordingly!
As you write, highlight any text on your page to bring up a menu of options. You can change the color or style of your text, add a comment or hyperlink, and more. Learn more about writing and editing basics here →

Create a subpage
There are no folders in Notion. Instead, you can organize pages inside pages... inside pages. Here, we'll show you how to create a page within another page, which we call a subpage 📑




Create a subpage
A subpage is a page inside a page. You can create any number of subpages for a page.
There are multiple ways to create a subpage:
Open a page (this will be the subpage’s parent page) and use the slash command /page.
Find your desired parent page in your sidebar and select + next to it. This will create a subpage in that page. When you return to the parent page, you’ll see the subpage there.
Once your new page opens, you can give your page a title and start jotting down your thoughts.
Need some inspiration or structure? On desktop or web, select any of the options at the bottom of the page to get started. You can import from an app or file, use a template, create a table, and more — select an option you like, and your page will be formatted accordingly!


Navigate with your sidebar and breadcrumbs
When you open the toggle for the parent page in your sidebar, you’ll see its subpages there. 
Additionally, at the top of your page, you’ll see breadcrumbs that show you what page you’re in, and where that page lives.


What is a database?
Databases are a core feature in Notion that help you manage and organize your pages. Let's explain what they are and how they can help you level up your workspace 🗄




Databases are collections of pages
Think of Notion databases as filing cabinets or notebooks. Each database serves as a container, letting you easily organize multiple Notion pages in a single structure. In the screenshot below, every row of the table is a page within the database "Docs."
This gives you a birds' eye view of an entire collection of pages at once. When you need to dive deeper, each page in a database can be opened, revealing its detailed contents.


Databases are pages themselves
But wait - each database is also a page itself! This is powerful, because it allows you to move and nest databases alongside other content, just like any other page.


Databases have properties
To help you organize all of the pages within a database, properties can be added to contextualize, label, and augment each individual item.
You can then search, filter, and sort by these property values.


Create a database
Now we'll create a database and use it to show off essential database actions and features. You'll get to play with database properties, views, filters, and sorts - let's get into it 📈




Create a new table
Add a new page and under Get started with and select Table.
The first column is where you enter the name of your database pages. Each column in a Notion table corresponds to a property that gives your item context.
Click a property heading, then Edit property and Type to see all of your property choices.


Add data to your table
For this example, we'll create a task database.
Add some tasks you're working on in the Name column.
Now add some values to the Tags column using the multi-select property. The options could be something like P1, P2, and P3 to indicate the priority of a task.
Add a new property using the + button to the right of the Tags heading.
Change its name to Due Date. Click the property heading, then Edit property and Type and select Date. Now when you click on a cell under Due Date, you'll see the date picker. 


Open a row as a page
Every item in a Notion database is also a whole page of its own! You can add any content you want inside, including other databases.
To open a row as a page, hover over a cell in the Name column and click OPEN.
You can add or edit any properties. 
You can also add additional content into the body of the page.


Create new database views
You can create different views of the same data. Put it into a board, a calendar, a list, a gallery, or a timeline — depending on your needs. Let's try one.
Click + at the top of your table. Depending on your screen size, you may have to open the dropdown next to your current view and select Add view.
Give your new view a name and choose Board from the right-side menu.
This displays rows from your table into cards on a board, grouped by tag. Clicking on a card still opens it as a page. It's all the same content, just visualized in a different way!

Tip: Different views are good for different things, and you can have as many as you need!
Gallery view is great if you're storing images in your database. 
Lists are helpful for minimalist storage of documentation. 
Calendar view displays your pages by an assigned date property.
Timelines are useful for visualizing project dates and length. 



Start with a template
To help you take on a variety of challenges with Notion, we've created lots of templates that you can adopt and customize as your own — including 5 "starter templates" already in your workspace! Here's how to use them 💾




Starter templates
When you first sign up for Notion, you'll see a collection of 5 templates in your sidebar. These have been selected for you based on what you told us during onboarding. You can choose to add them to your workspace so you can edit them however you want, or remove them.
To delete a template:
Click the ••• to the right of the page name.
Then click Delete.


Find & use in-app templates
You can access our full collection of in-app templates at any time. Look for Templates in your sidebar.
Click Get template to actually add one to your workspace.
Instructions are included inside each template in two ways:
For databases, they are at the top and can be hidden by hovering over the top of the page and clicking Hide description.
For pages, instructions are scattered throughout in callout boxes that you can delete just like you'd delete any other content block.


Duplicate community-made templates
In addition to in-app templates, you can duplicate a public page into your own workspace as template. Learn more about public pages here →

The Notion Template Gallery includes thousands of templates built for many purposes by Notion users around the world, which you can use as a starting point (or inspiration ✨)! Once you've duplicated a public template page into your own workspace, tweak it to match your workflow perfectly.

Share your work
Share any Notion page you create with select people, your whole team, or the entire web. It's up to you. Here's a quick overview of how to share 🗣




Share with one person
You can invite people inside or outside your workspace to share a Notion page with you.
Start with your page in Private in your sidebar.
On the page, go to Share at the top right.
Enter the person's name or email address in the space provided, choose a level of access, and click Invite.
If the person is outside your workspace, they'll join the page as a guest.
If the person is already a member of your workspace, you'll see their profile photo pop up in the invite menu, and the page will show up under Shared in your sidebar, as seen above.


Share with your team
If you have multiple people working with you in Notion, you can quickly share any page with all of them. There are several ways to do this:
Share with everyone in your workspace. Click Share at the top right of the page, and grant access to Everyone at [workspace name]. You can also assign everyone in your workspace a particular access level from the dropdown. For example, everyone Can view instead of being able to edit.
Create a page in any default teamspace in your sidebar. Everyone in your workspace is a member of default teamspaces and will automatically have access to pages in them. Learn more about teamspaces → 


Learn more about teamspaces →
Drag a private page to a default teamspace in your sidebar. This automatically shares it with everyone.
Share a page's URL. Every page in Notion has its own unique URL you can use to share it on Slack or elsewhere. Go to Share at the top right and click Copy link. Only people who have access to the page can see it.


Share with the web
You can easily turn your Notion page into a beautiful website with Notion Sites. Learn more about how to share your page with the web here →


Collaborate with people
Notion has several features designed to improve and increase the velocity of communication with your team — whether you're all editing the same page or working across time zones 🤝




Work together in real-time
You can edit the same page at the same time with an unlimited number of people.
Their profile photos will show you where they're looking or working on the page.
Edits and comments made by everyone will appear to you instantly.
Click 🕘 at the top of the page to see who made what changes and when.
Content added is highlighted in blue.
Gray strikethrough shows what's been removed.
You can also see where people have left comments.


Start a conversation
There are several ways to communicate with your teammates inside Notion — hopefully helping you cut down on meetings and status checks.


Mention a teammate
Want to get someone's attention on a page?
Mention them by typing @ followed by their name anywhere on a page.
You'll see a menu pop up that will search for the person in real time. Press enter.
They'll be notified of your mention with a link directly to it in their Inbox (or with a push notification if they are on the desktop or mobile app).


Leave a comment
Comments let you attach your thoughts, questions, or opinions to specific content on a page.
To leave a comment on a page, click the Add comment right above its title.
To leave a comment on text, highlight it, and click Comment in the menu that pops up.
To leave a comment on an image, embed, or other type of block, you can click the ••• that appears at the top right or the ⋮⋮ icon that appears to the left on hover. Choose Comment from the menu that pops up. (You can also right click to bring it up!)
You can @-mention your colleagues in comments to get their attention.
