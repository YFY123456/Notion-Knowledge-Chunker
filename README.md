# Notion-Knowledge-Chunker

This Python script is designed to scrape and process content from the Notion help center. It performs the following tasks:

1.Fetch Category URLs: Retrieves URLs for all help categories from the Notion help center homepage.
2.Fetch Article Content: For each category URL, it collects article titles, introductions, and core content while preserving the structure of text elements like paragraphs, headers, and links.
3.Organize and Store Content: Compiles the fetched content into structured chunks, and saves this organized data into a text file.
The script utilizes requests for HTTP requests and BeautifulSoup for parsing HTML content. It filters and processes data to ensure that related content is grouped together and outputs the results in a human-readable format.
